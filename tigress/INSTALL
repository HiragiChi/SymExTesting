This is Tigress, the C obfuscator, downloaded from tigress.wtf.

This is a fat distribution, with binaries for multiple platforms. Files for each platform go in
   PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY/tigress/3.0/Darwin-x86_64
   PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY/tigress/3.0/Linux-armv7
   PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY/tigress/3.0/Linux-x86_64

To install, you need to set the TIGRESS_HOME environment variable:
   export TIGRESS_HOME="/home/hiragi/Desktop/jpf/tigress/3.0"

You also need to add this directory to your PATH:
   export PATH="/home/hiragi/Desktop/jpf/tigress/3.0:$PATH"

The tigress script will pick up the right binary to use by trying to figure out which
platform you're on, using "uname -s" and "uname -m". If your uname returns strange
values, this may fail.

To try out Tigress, do
     tigress --Environment=x86_64:Linux:Gcc:4.6 --Transform=Virtualize --Functions=main --out=result.c ~/Desktop/jpf/tigress/3.0/test2.c
         where ENV is one of
             x86_64:Linux:Gcc:4.6
             x86_64:Darwin:Clang:5.1
             armv7:Linux:Gcc:4.6 
             armv8:Linux:Gcc:4.6
This should give you and obfuscated program in result.c.
