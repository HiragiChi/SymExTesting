## File Introduction
### formulaGeneration.py
main file for generating testing cases and run tests. Detailed function information can be found in the formulaGeneration.py file.

### recordAA.md
Record a couple of results and interesting things found in the testing.

## formulaGeneration.py
Can generate a large number of linear or quadratic formulas and constraints with "SAT" and "UNSAT" labelled

## easyFusion.py
The fusion function can be used to semantically fuse function.

## Folder test
Temporary files used for testing 

## Folder result
Record temporary results

## Folder inputGeneration
Prototypes used in testScriptClass.py to generate test cases.

## Folder formatRecipe
A couple of constraints containing linear and quadratic formulas, with multiple labels.

## APermanentResult
Permanently record result for different testing, currently only unit test result is recorded.
